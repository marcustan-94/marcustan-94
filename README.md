<h1 align="center">Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Marcus</h1>
<h3 align="center">An aspiring data scientist</h3>

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a Kaggle competition on Predicting Effective Arguments  
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning NLP techniques, Spacy, NLTK

After graduating with a degree in pharmacy, I moved on to become an associate scientist at a food tech start-up, working specifically on research and development of plant-based foods. During my time there, I was exposed to what my data science colleagues were working on, and I was amazed at the possibilities and capabilities that data science could achieve. Hence, I decided to pivot my career towards data science and has recently completed a full-time data science bootcamp offered by Le Wagon.

My interests and passion lie in using data science to solve problems related to the food, healthcare and environment sectors. Feel free to drop me an email at **marcustanjh94@gmail.com** or visit my [Linkedin profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/marcus-tan-jh/) if you'd like to connect, collaborate or ask anything!

### Le Wagon Coding Bootcamp Projects

#### 1. [DDI - a drug drug interaction machine learning model](https://github.com/marcustan-94/ddi)
For the Le Wagon capstone project, my team and I worked on designing a machine learning model that is capable of predicting all possible side effects of any given two drugs, using just the SMILES strings of the drugs. The data for this project was retrieved from the TWOSIDES dataset, available from [Therapeutic Drug Commons](https://tdcommons.ai/multi_pred_tasks/ddi/). Preprocessing and feature engineering was done to calculate the chemical properties of the drugs. Principal Component Analysis was then performed to select the most important features. We then explored various models and eventually settled on a Random Forest Classifier model, balancing between model accuracy and time taken to train. The model was then packaged into Streamlit and deployed into Heroku as a web application, link can be found [here](https://ddi-lewagon.herokuapp.com/) (*note: if loading for the first time, please allow ~30-60 seconds for the website to load*).


#### 2. [Taxi Fare Predictor (New York)](https://github.com/marcustan-94/taxifare)

The goal of this project is to predict the taxi fare for a taxi ride in New York City given the pickup and dropoff locations, date, time and passenger count. The data for this project was obtained from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/new-york-city-taxi-fare-prediction). I first performed preprocessing to clean up the dataset such as removing outliers and rows with missing information. Next, feature engineering was done to extract time and distance features from the dataset. Using RMSE as the evaluation metric, I then explored various models and decided on a Random Forest Regressor model eventually. The model was then packaged into Streamlit and deployed into Heroku as a web application, link can be found [here](https://taxifare-marcus.herokuapp.com/) (*note: if loading for the first time, please allow ~30-60 seconds for the website to load*).
